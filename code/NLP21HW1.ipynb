      "  A bagel is traditionally a hefty, dense ring of somewhat bland tasting\n",
      "  bread. But with different flours, such as rye and wheat, bagels take\n",
      "  on different tastes. Add raisins, blueberries, strawberries, dates\n",
      "  and nuts for a dessert-like bagel. Add veggies, onions, poppy seeds,\n",
      "  peanut butter and other ingredients for an infinite variety of taste\n",
      "  combinations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The popularity of bagels is as much attributed to what you can put on\n",
      "  them and in them as to what you add to the unbaked dough. They are\n",
      "  the perfect vehicles for spreads. Most often spreads consist of a\n",
      "  cream cheese base that may be mixed with salmon or lox, fruits,\n",
      "  vegetables and spices -- in myriad combinations. There are regional\n",
      "  differences in how bagels are made, and ongoing arguments about what\n",
      "  constitutes the \"perfect\" bagel and best spread combination.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The traditional bagel sandwich consists of cream cheese, lox, a slice\n",
      "  of onion and a slice of tomato. But that's only the beginning. Bagel\n",
      "  sandwiches are so popular that bagel bakeries often list 40 or 50\n",
      "  sandwich variations on their menus. then there are mini bagels and\n",
      "  bialys. For catered bagel brunches, there are 3- to 6- pound bagels\n",
      "  that are filled and then cut into pie shaped wedges.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Bagels have a lot going for them. They don't crush or smash while\n",
      "  being carried; they don't melt from the heat or suffer from freezing.\n",
      "  They're at their optimum goodness when fresh and hot from out of the\n",
      "  oven, but they're delicious, too, even when frozen, thawed and\n",
      "  toasted. If they get stale, they can be made into bagel chips or\n",
      "  ground into bread crumbs. They're an all-around convenient, no-waste\n",
      "  food product that is well suited to today's health conscious\n",
      "  consumers.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The plain water bagel is low in calories compared to other traditional\n",
      "  breakfast foods. Estimates as to the number of calories in a bagel\n",
      "  differ, and its size is a factor. Most bagels weigh 4 to 5 ounces,\n",
      "  and tally up to between 150 to 200 calories. The addition of nuts,\n",
      "  raisins, berries, chocolate chips and other ingredients will add to\n",

      "  3 ounces, so the calories vary accordingly.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  It's the toppings and spreads that shoot up the calorie tab, though\n",
      "  this can be tempered by using light and fat-free cheeses, and spreads\n",
      "  without cheese. A whopping dollop of cream cheese slapped onto each\n",
      "  half of a bagel (2 tablespoons of cream cheese have 10 grams of fat\n",
